## Project Description
This function cleans the UCI HAR Dataset into a usable form and calculates the mean for each variable. 

##Study design and data processing

###Collection of the raw data
The data used is available at: https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip

It was collected by Smartlab - Non Linear Complex Systems Laboratory at DITEN - Universitâ€¡ degli Studi di Genova.

30 volunteers wore a Samsung Galaxy S II smartphone while performing 6 activities (walking, walking upstairs, walking downstairs, laying, sitting, and standing). The embedded accelerometer and gyroscope recorded velocity and acceleration information. 

###Notes on the original (raw) data 
The data was pre-preocessed with noise filters and sliding windows. The acceleration data was seperated into gravitational and body motion components.  The data is also split into two sections: training and test data. 

##Creating the tidy datafile

###Guide to create the tidy data file
Prior to running the function:
1. Download the data. 
2. Unzip the data to a local folder. 
3. Set the R working directory to the folder containing the unzipped UCI HAR Dataset folder. 
4. Import the run_analysis script into R. 
5. Run run_analysis().

###Cleaning of the data -- What the code does
Action taken in Run_Analysis.R:
1. Load DPLYR Library
2. Read all necessary tables into R. 
3. Add column names to the tables.
4. For the training and test data, seperately: merge the Subject ID (subject_train/test), Activity Number(y_train/test), and Meausrement (X_train/test) data together by binding the columns into a new table.
5. Merge the training and test data into one table by binding the rows together. 
6. Join the Activity Label data into the new table so each record has a descriptive label. 
7. Clean up the column names for easier understanding. 
8. Create a list of the variables that include measurements of mean or standard deviation. Add reference variables (Subject ID, Activity Number/Label) to the list. 
9. Subest the data of intrest (means and standard deviations) along with the reference data. 
10. Group the subset data by Subject ID and Activity Number. 11. Calculate the mean of each measured variable for each group and store in a new table. 
12. Clean up the column names and column order in the new table.
13. Export the table to a text file.
