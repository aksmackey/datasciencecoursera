## Project Description
This function cleans the UCI HAR Dataset into a usable form and calculates the mean for each variable. 

##Study design and data processing

###Collection of the raw data
The data used is available at: https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip

It was collected by Smartlab - Non Linear Complex Systems Laboratory at DITEN - Universitâ€¡ degli Studi di Genova.

30 volunteers wore a Samsung Galaxy S II smartphone while performing 6 activities (walking, walking upstairs, walking downstairs, laying, sitting, and standing). The embedded accelerometer and gyroscope recorded velocity and acceleration information. 

###Notes on the original (raw) data 
The data was pre-preocessed with noise filters and sliding windows. The acceleration data was seperated into gravitational and body motion components.  The data is also split into two sections: training and test data. 

##Creating the tidy datafile

###Guide to create the tidy data file
Prior to running the function:
1. Download the data. 
2. Unzip the data to a local folder. 
3. Set the R working directory to the folder containing the unzipped UCI HAR Dataset folder. 
4. Import the run_analysis script into R. 
5. Run run_analysis().

###Cleaning of the data
The run analysis merges all of the relevant tables in the UCI HAR Dataset together such that each measurement is associate with one Subject ID and one Activity Number/Label and the table is labeled in an easily understandable manner. The dataset is then subest to include only mean and standard deviation variables. Calculations then produce a final table (tidy_data.txt) that includes the mean of each measured variable for each Subject performing each Activity. 

The code is described in further detail at: 

##Description of the variables in the tidy_data.txt file

The dimensions of the dataset are 180 rows and 89 columns. 

A summary of each variable is provided within each variable's section of this document. 

Each row represents one Subject completing one Activity. There are 6 rows for each Subject and 30 rows for each Activity for a total of 180 rows.

The first three columns indicate identify the Subject (SubjectID), and the Activity (ActivityNumber and ActivityLabel). Both the ActivityNumber and the ActivityLabel were included in the final table to account for potential needs of future users. 

The additional columns then inlcudes a mean value for each of the following variables: 
"tBodyAcc_mean_X", "tBodyAcc_mean_Y", "tBodyAcc_mean_Z", "tBodyAcc_std_X", "tBodyAcc_std_Y", "tBodyAcc_std_Z", "tGravityAcc_mean_X", "tGravityAcc_mean_Y", "tGravityAcc_mean_Z", "tGravityAcc_std_X", "tGravityAcc_std_Y", "tGravityAcc_std_Z", "tBodyAccJerk_mean_X", "tBodyAccJerk_mean_Y", "tBodyAccJerk_mean_Z", "tBodyAccJerk_std_X", "tBodyAccJerk_std_Y", "tBodyAccJerk_std_Z", "tBodyGyro_mean_X", "tBodyGyro_mean_Y", "tBodyGyro_mean_Z", "tBodyGyro_std_X", "tBodyGyro_std_Y", "tBodyGyro_std_Z", "tBodyGyroJerk_mean_X", "tBodyGyroJerk_mean_Y", "tBodyGyroJerk_mean_Z", "tBodyGyroJerk_std_X", "tBodyGyroJerk_std_Y", "tBodyGyroJerk_std_Z", "tBodyAccMag_mean", "tBodyAccMag_std", "tGravityAccMag_mean", "tGravityAccMag_std", "tBodyAccJerkMag_mean", "tBodyAccJerkMag_std", "tBodyGyroMag_mean", "tBodyGyroMag_std", "tBodyGyroJerkMag_mean", "tBodyGyroJerkMag_std", "fBodyAcc_mean_X", "fBodyAcc_mean_Y", "fBodyAcc_mean_Z", "fBodyAcc_std_X", "fBodyAcc_std_Y", "fBodyAcc_std_Z", "fBodyAcc_meanFreq_X", "fBodyAcc_meanFreq_Y", "fBodyAcc_meanFreq_Z", "fBodyAccJerk_mean_X", "fBodyAccJerk_mean_Y", "fBodyAccJerk_mean_Z", "fBodyAccJerk_std_X", "fBodyAccJerk_std_Y", "fBodyAccJerk_std_Z", "fBodyAccJerk_meanFreq_X", "fBodyAccJerk_meanFreq_Y", "fBodyAccJerk_meanFreq_Z", "fBodyGyro_mean_X", "fBodyGyro_mean_Y", "fBodyGyro_mean_Z", "fBodyGyro_std_X", "fBodyGyro_std_Y", "fBodyGyro_std_Z", "fBodyGyro_meanFreq_X", "fBodyGyro_meanFreq_Y", "fBodyGyro_meanFreq_Z", "fBodyAccMag_mean", "fBodyAccMag_std", "fBodyAccMag_meanFreq", "fBodyAccJerkMag_mean", "fBodyAccJerkMag_std", "fBodyAccJerkMag_meanFreq", "fBodyGyroMag_mean", "fBodyGyroMag_std", "fBodyGyroMag_meanFreq", "fBodyGyroJerkMag_mean", "fBodyGyroJerkMag_std", "fBodyGyroJerkMag_meanFreq", "angle(tBodyAccMean,gravity)", "angle(tBodyAccJerkMean),gravityMean)", "angle(tBodyGyroMean,gravityMean), "angle(tBodyGyroJerkMean,gravityMean)", "angle(X,gravityMean)", "angle(Y,gravityMean)", "angle(Z,gravityMean)" 

The column names for each of the measured variables were altered slightly from the original names. They were reformatted into more readable formats. Specifically, all "-" were converted to "_", all extraneous "()" were removed, and duplications of the word "Body" were removed. The abbreviations in the column names were left "as-is" because the names would be too long for easy comprehension with unabreviated words. The abbreviations are listed below:
t - time domain signal
f - frequency domain signal
Acc - Accelerometer
Gyro - Gyroscope
Mag - Magnitude
std - standard deviation
Freq - frequency
X/Y/Z - Direction of movement
